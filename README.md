# Card Manipulation
This project is a small practice where you can manipulate the size and appearance of a card, with the ability to change its dimensions using input fields. The card has two icons (one normal and one inverted), and a number in the center. Additionally, you can apply a flip effect to the card by clicking a button.

## Features

- Responsiveness: The design adapts to different screen sizes, keeping the interface functional on both mobile and desktop devices.
## Technologies Used
- HTML5 for the page structure.
- CSS3 for styling, including media queries for responsiveness.
- JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and handle user events.
